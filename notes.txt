  // adding the button that delete the income and expense

  // we will use event delegation

  // putting the even handeler to the parent of orignal element

  // create a function controll delete item -- we will pass event in this function to
                                               know what the target element is.... the 
                                               child of the parent on which we have added
                                               the evnet listener

  // it will be in our app controller

  // what we want in to this function 

  // to see where the event was first targeted is by using the target property

  // now we are using the parentNode propety... WHY? because we are intrested in the
     whole item.. because we are gona delete the item not only the targeted element..
     also we are intrested in the id too..

  // now save it in the variable


  // now we want all this event delegation stuff to happen if there is itemID existed

  // now what we are gona do with that id

  // first there is type and than the id 
  

  // format of id is inc-1 --- example

  // we will use split method that all strings have 

  // store it in variable 

  // splitId = itemId.split('-');

  // split method allows us to split the string in to components

  // now the first element of string is type

  // the second element fo string is id


  // now what he had to do list on this part of application


      1) delete the item from the data structue

      2) delte the item from the UI

      3) Update and show the new budget










// lec 13


  // now to delete the item from the budget controller --- 1st step

   
    /// Yet another method to loop over an array: map


    /// Howto remove elements from an array using the splice method


  // create a method deleteItem in budget controller 

   now what we want is 

   to see the type and the id right because every element has its 
   
   unique id... we need type and id as a perimater ....  

   ...  
  
   as all the ids are not in line 
   therefore we will create an array 
   that will have all the ids and than we will check
   the index of input id and use this information to
   delete it..

 
   ... loop over all the items

   ... we will use map for array it is sam like is forEach
   .. map returns a brand new array
   .. we return something and it is store in brand new array

---------- now to find the index ids ....
 
 [1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ] index of 5 is 3

if index actually exists then we want to find the indexOf of ids 

index is here the variable containing the indexOf of ids

now if index is !== -1 
then 
we wawnt the allItems[type].splice method

splice(positionNumber , number Of elements we want to delet)
--------------------------|--------------------------------
                          |
                          this is the splice mehtod
                          two arguments pass in to it 
                          








now use this method in our controllDeleteItem

convert the ID to inteager it is currently a string












// lec 14 

  .. removing the element from the UI

  .. we are going to create a method in our UI

  .. first we need an id to remove it

  .. the id we have passed in the method is goint to be the entire id
  .. for example income-1 or whatever


  .. we have to remove child method
  .. we have to first need to move up to see the parent

  .. we will use paerentNode property to move up

  .. and then removeChild
  .. in removeChild whe have to pass whole element

  .. so first save it in variable
  .. 



 now just call it in ctrlDeleteItem
 

 now update the method of update the budget();

  // Updating the Percentages Controller

  .. percentages are going to be updated when a new income is going to be add
     or going to be delated for both income and expenses

  .. creating an updatePercentage funciton

   1 : - Calculate percentages

   2:-  Read percentages from the budget Contrller

   3:- Update the UI with the new Percentages

 

  call it in other two funciton

  in addItem and deleatingitem one in app controller




  .. in our expense and in our income funciotn constructue we 
     are going to add the protype
     call it for expenses
      

  


------------------------------------------------------------------------
  


  -- first we have created a method to calcuate the percentage
  -- then we have created a method to reterive the percentage 
  -- now to calculate the method for each expense array
  -- here we only want the exp array 
  -- to get this method to all the expense item we are going to loop over
     the items 
  -- for that we will use forEach method as it gives the property not reterive
     the new array
  -- what we want is that for each mehtod should have the calcPercentage method
  -- now we want the get percentage method on all of the expense items
  -- now here we note that we need to return the array containg the caclPercentage
  -- for that we will use map mehtod 
  -- 


   now call the calculatePercentages and getPercentages

 Updating the percentages in UI



  how to create our own forEach function but for nodeLists instead of arrays
  
   
  .. as we know we are going to create a metho in our UI controller
  .. what we will display is percentages
  .. Where will we display is 

     going to be --- in expenses item there is a class for percentage check in index.html
  
 create a variable and store where we want to display these percentags

  we will use querySelectorAll
  
now we know that Node list cannot have forEach method

 

  therefore we are creating our own method for Nodelist ------------ 
                           
                  first we have created a variable nodeLIstForEach(you can name whatever you want) contiang a function passing two parameters one is the list and another is callback funtion

                  now what we want is to loop over each nodelist item using for loops 
                  and than call the callback functtion ------ first class function
                  

                  now create the callbackfunction

Formating our numbers

. How to use different String methods to manipulate Strings
. 

  first we will create a mehtod in our  UIcontroller

  it will have two parameters  the current number and the type
  weather it is inc or exp

  . first we will ue abs method to remove every sing 

  . by doing this num = Math.abs(num)
  
  . and then use toFixed method to display decimal after 2 numbers

  . now we want to put comma if the number is greater than thousand or thousand
  
  . using if statment
  

  . before that split the num 

  now the first Part is th number(inteager) and other is the decimal one
  
     
  now if the frist part is greater than the lenght of 3 than
  

  there is another method call substr(start , ending position) then the last part after the coma 


the another part of splitstring is 

 dec = numSplit[1]



now check if type is equal to exp than - and if it is 
inc than +
